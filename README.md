# Sort NPM Scripts

Keep your `package.json` orderly by alphabetizing the `scripts`, `dependencies`, & `devDependencies` objects by running this script.

## Usage

Must be ran in same directory as a `package.json`

### One time run

```bash
npx sort-npm-scripts
```

### Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev sort-npm-scripts
```

Great to use with `husky` & `lint-stagged`!
